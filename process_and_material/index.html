            <h1>Technical notes</h1>
            <p>The work that I have produced more recently has employed a variety of materials, but often starts out as a clay piece, which is cast and altered in a new state as a plaster form.</p>
            <p>It may go on to become a clay piece once more, which is then further modified. Each material affords new opportunities for subtlety and exploration.</p>
            <p>The final material is fired clay, which is altered by smoothing and polishing by hand.</p>
            <p>My way of working is intricately linked with direct feelings for relationships of positive and negative form, which develop through making and remaking a form.</p>

            <h1>Making</h1>
            <p>The following slides (Evolution 1-5) show one piece evolving.</p>

            <p>The idea for a piece has to come from a sensation, feeling or emotion about a positive or negative space.</p>
            <p>I then try to capture and manipulate the results of that impulse by casting a form in plaster.</p>
            <p>Of course the first cast is only the beginning and it may lead to others, both positive and negative to make a form, which I then alter by carving.</p>

            <p>This series of slides show a recent piece, which I wanted to enlarge to a new scale to explore a bigger gestural activity and to find a new spatial orientation</p>
