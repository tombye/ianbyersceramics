            <h1>Statement</h1>
            <p>My work has evolved from a figurative mode with a suggested narrative that allowed many readings, through to a pure visual one.</p>
            <p>The main focus of my work in the last ten years has been sculptural, working with forms, which can be read differently from several viewpoints in space.</p>
            <p>Images have developed from the early figurative concerns through to a preoccupation with underlying compositions.</p>
            <p>In particular I have been dealing with light and shadow, positive and negative, as much as building forms.</p>
            <p>With these elements in mind the work has shed surface additions aiming for directness and simplicity of surface.</p>
            <h2>The Liminal series</h2>
            <p>Some of my work has been titled <em>&ldquo;Liminal&rdquo;</em></p>
            <i class="definition">The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word as, 1: relating to a transitional or initial stage. 2: at a boundary or threshold.</i>
            <p>The making came first, the word I stumbled upon and liked its suggestive power as an introduction to a body of work.</p>
            <p>As human beings we have to build an understanding of our three-dimensional world, in order for us to recognise objects, to touch, navigate and contemplate.</p>
            <p>Although my work had often been based on some figuration, within this group of objects I have been deconstructing and reconstructing pure form, allowing relationships of structure and light to gather in new ways.</p>
