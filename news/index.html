            <h2 class="heading-level-1">Edenbridge exhibition</h2>
            <p>Drawings, prints, sculpted ceramics and found objects all feature, collide and meld in this show of recent work. I feel that I am evolving a new visual language, which can be used to express and explore a world of ideas, change and renewal, of our connectedness to materials and their physical and emotional resonance.</p>

                <p>This film was made with the intention of shining a light on a body of new work, which brings together various modes of expression, drawing, printing, found objects, ceramic sculptural form, and a crude sensual use of clay.</p>
                <p>This way of working is new to me coming after a long period of making and exhibiting internationally work centred on a series of minimalist, painstakingly-made, ceramic sculptures. It also introduces the spoken word, titles and labels and another visual angle and thus
interpretation on what I was able to do in the space.</p>
                <p>The instinctive expressions of the freely made ceramics, challenges what has gone before and indicates the possible marriage of modes of working. It is about opening up and expansion.</p>

            <p>I've written an article called <a href="/mining_uncertainty">mining uncertainty in Taiwan</a> containing reflections of my time at Yingge along with a bit about my history to give it context.</p>
            <p>Images of the work I produced during this time can be seen in the new <a href="/galleries/works-in-progress-2013/artworks/28/">Yingge gallery</a>.

                <p>I've been interviewed about the work for this show.</p>

                    <p>I've been working with ceramics for a long time, actually and with one material and it's the material I emotionally respond to.</p>
                    <p>When you look at the work in the exhibition you'll see that actually there are really 2 different groups of work but they are related as well. Some of the work has got a strange name, <em>liminal</em> which means something is on a threshold, it could become something else and the other work is called <em>-gen</em> which I hope, when you look at the work you'll actually see it means something in relation to things like to generate something, to create something and it's really about life, you know, it's really about how life becomes, it changes, becomes something else all the time, we can never actually stay still, even in our lifetimes, all our cells change.</p>
                    <p>The show I think is interesting, it involves different people at different stages in their careers and I think that's part of the debate that could come out of this exhibition is what will be the future for ceramics, you know what's going to happen?</p>
                    <p>Education seems to be in a state of flux. We're at a stage where digitisation seems to be taking over in all forms of life and yet I think it's really important that we keep in touch with materials and being able to develop ourselves as much as the objects that we make through a knowledge and understanding of materials.</p>
